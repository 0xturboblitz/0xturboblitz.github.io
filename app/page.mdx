I currently work on [OpenPassport](https://openpassport.app/), a passport proving protocol using zk-SNARKs.

I love math, computer science and technology. I'm currently trying to learn as much applied zk cryptography and ML interpretability as possible.

Previously, I ran a [french youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@FlorentTavernier) and founded a [traditional sculpture atelier](https://www.ateliermissor.com).
